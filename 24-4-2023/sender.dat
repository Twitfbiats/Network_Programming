For Developers: Enabling File Sharing

As explained on the following article on StackOverflow:

"You just have to set UIFileSharingEnabled (Application Supports iTunes file sharing) key in the info plist of your app. Here's a link for the documentation. Scroll down to the file sharing support part.

You must also define CFBundleDisplayName (Bundle Display Name), if it isn't already there. More details here."
